# How to Help Us Translate Kornblume

Hey everyone, we are translating the site into other languagts and need your help.

Let's understand how to help us with the translation.

## For Non-Developers

Please copy the file from [here](https://github.com/windbow27/Kornblume/blob/main/lang/en-US.json)

For example:

```
"summon-tracker": "Summon Tracker",
```

The part before the `:` is the key that identifies the translation, and the `"Summon Tracker"` after it is the actual content to be translated.

We ask for your assistance in editing the content after the `:`

If you are done or encounter any issues during the process, feel free to reach out to us.

You can contact @windbow through Discord.

We appreciate any help, thank you!

## For Developers

First, clone the repo to your local.

Then, we recommend using VScode and installing the [i18n Ally](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lokalise.i18n-ally) extension, which can make this whole process a lot easier.

After loading the extension, you can see the **Progress** of the translation in the interface.

Set **EN-US** as the source language first.

Then, for the language you wish to translate, simply click on the corresponding string, and the translation interface will pop up.
